                Welcome to Appointa. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application.
              </p>

              <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                We collect information that you provide directly to us or that we collect automatically when you use our services.
              </p>
              <h4>a. For Service Providers (You)</h4>
                <p>
                    When you create an account, we collect personal information such as your name and email address. If you choose to connect your Google Calendar, we also store the necessary authentication tokens from Google to allow us to create and manage calendar events on your behalf.

                <p>
                    When your clients book an appointment using your public booking link, we collect the information they provide, including their name, email address, and phone number. This information is stored and associated with your account.
                </p>

              <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

                <li>Allowing clients to book appointments with you.</li>
                <li>Enabling you to manage your client list and view appointment history.</li>
                <li>Syncing appointments with your Google Calendar, if you have connected it.</li>
                <li>Sending transactional emails, such as booking confirmations or cancellations (functionality simulated).</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third-party marketers. Your client information is under your control as the service provider. We will not contact your clients for any reason other than transactional notifications related to their bookings with you.
                </p>

              <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
              <p>
